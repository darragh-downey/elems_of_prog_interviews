# Elements of Programming Interviews

Based on Elements of Programming Interviews by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee and Amit Prakash.

Will mix up implementations [in order of likelyhood] between Go, Python, Rust, C/C++.

As it's a monorepo will likely use Bazel to run builds and tests.


## Requirements

Each implementation *should* have:

* A readme outlining the problem and the approach taken to resolve it.
* Comments on functions and unclear code 
* Clear, clean, concise code - no mega functions
* Tests 


*see A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout
